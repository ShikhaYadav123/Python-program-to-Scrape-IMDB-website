# Python-program-webscraping-from-good reads website
Python program to Scrape Good reads website using BeautifulSoup, Pandas and Requests libraries. The results were downloaded in an Excel file. 

BeautifulSoup was used to parse and extract HTML content from Good Reads website. 
1) Scrapped the 'List of Genres' and its 'URL'. The scrapped data was exported to Excel file 'Genres_and_URL.xlsx'
2) Scraped the top 30 Categories per each Genre using an iteration method. Also the respective information - 'URLs', 'No. of Books', 'No. of Voters' was also scraped for each category per Genre. (Note: first the code was written for only single category under Romance, then the same code was improved for every category under each genres.)

Happy Learning! :)
